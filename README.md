## My process

1. I started with the markup on index.html, complying with HTML5 semantic tags and standards as much as possible.
2. The styling provided by the project briefing was implemented first, followed by the classes I came up with on the markup.
3. I used Figma to acquire all the right dimensions involved in the layout and implemented them in the appropriate CSS classes.
4. The [CSS Cube](https://cube.fyi/) methodology was used when coding the stylesheet and some of the conventions from BEM were used when naming classes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Cube CSS methodology

### What I learned

- Got more familiar with the use of the `position` CSS property.
- Getting the SVG circular linear-gradients to their right positions was a challenge. It took me longer than expected but it all worked out in the end.
